# Creating an Azure Resource Manager Template Project in Visual Studio

The following high-level steps show you how to create a basic virtual machine Azure Resource Manager template in Visual Studio:

1. In Visual Studio, create a new Azure Resource Group project.

2. From the available templates, select Windows Virtual Machine.

3. This will create a project with the three files listed in the previous section.

4. This is a fully functional template that you can deploy by using ARM. You also can alter this template if required.

Several templates are freely available on GitHub. These range from basic templates to complex templates that can deploy complete infrastructure such as SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups.
