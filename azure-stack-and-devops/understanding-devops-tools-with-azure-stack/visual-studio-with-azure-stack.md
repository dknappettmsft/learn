# Visual Studio with Azure Stack

Microsoft provides Visual Studio as a development tool for creating applications. The types of applications that you can create are ASP.NET web applications, desktop applications, server applications, XML Web Services, REST APIs, and mobile applications for various platforms. Visual Studio uses a single integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to create applications regardless of the development language you choose, whether it is VB.NET, C#, or Visual C++.

Visual Studio can connect to an Azure Stack subscription just as it would connect to an Azure subscription. By using Visual Studio, you can deploy applications directly to the Azure Stack infrastructure. For example, you can create an ASP.NET application and deploy it straight to an Azure Stack App Service. In addition to this, Visual Studio can integrate into code repositories such as Visual Studio Team Services, Team Foundation Server, or GitHub.

By connecting Visual Studio to code repositories, you can configure continuous deployment of applications to the Azure Stack App Service. This will ensure that applications are updated without requiring involvement from other teams.

During the deployment of an Azure Stack App Service, you can connect the service to a code repository such as GitHub, BitBucket, Dropbox, or Microsoft OneDrive. When connecting to a GitHub repository, you must authorize Azure Stack to have access. After you have authorized access, you can choose the project and the branch required.
