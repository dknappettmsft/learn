# Offering Database as a Service to users

After you have installed the SQL resource provider and the MySQL resource provider, added the hosting servers to the required Azure Stack regions, and created the quotas for user consumption, you must add the services to a plan.

Module 4, "Offering Microsoft Azure Stack Resources" described how to add services to a plan and how to add plans to offers. We recommend that you create a dedicated plan for Database as a Service and add the required services to the plan. You can then add this Plan to any offer.
