# Alerting and Notifications

When Operations Manager detects a problem in the environment, it can generate an alert that you can view in the Operations Manager console. An alert can be in three states: Informational, Warning, or Critical. This enables operators to filter their view in the console to show only the required alerts, such as critical alerts. In addition to alerts available in the console, Operations Manager can also send email or instant message (IM) notifications to operators when they do not have access to the console. Moreover, you can configure notifications such that they are only sent at specific times. For example, during working hours, when a problem is detected, an alert is generated in the console. Outside of working hours however, an email notification is sent.
