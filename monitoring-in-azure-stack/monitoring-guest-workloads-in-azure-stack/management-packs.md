# Management Packs

Management Packs in Operations Manager provide the monitoring, reporting, diagnostic, and recovery capabilities for each application they were designed for. For example, the SQL Server Management Pack includes monitoring for all aspects of SQL Server including its databases, Windows services, transaction log files, SQL Server jobs, and so on. It also includes reports and diagnostic tasks that you can use to troubleshoot problems with SQL Server. Each rule and monitor that a Management Pack includes has default monitoring thresholds that are set by Microsoft (or by the author of the Management Pack). These thresholds are set as best practices learnt from teams of engineers who have used the product extensively in the field. In most cases, the thresholds are set appropriately for most environments but you can change these thresholds by using an override. Management Packs also include useful information about each rule or monitor, which includes a description of the rule or monitor and how to fix the problem it has detected. You can also include company knowledge that can be used to help fix a problem related to your specific environment.
