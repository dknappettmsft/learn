# Reporting, Dashboards, and Operations Console

## Reporting and Dashboards

As mentioned previously, each Management Pack can include reports that you can run, schedule, and export from the Operations Manager console. Reports are also context sensitive. For example, when you select a Windows server in the console, you can select relevant reports that relate to a Windows server such as disk utilization or memory utilization reports. You can also create dashboards to visualize collected data. For example, you can create a dashboard that includes a graph of CPU utilization, related alerts, and a state view that shows the current health state of a monitored Windows server. You can include all these components in the dashboard in a single view. You can also publish this view to an Office SharePoint Server web page and make it available for others to view, such as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO).

## Operations Console and Web Console

Both administrators and operators can use a fully scoped Operations Manager Console or Web Console that includes HTML5-based dashboards to access relevant monitored data and collected metrics. The console can be scoped such that when operators log in, their access is filtered to only show data related to them. For example, when the SQL DB Admin logs into the console, the admin will only see collected data and alerts related to the monitored SQL servers. Additionally, you can create custom views to filter data and alerts. This can be useful when you require a targeted view to help troubleshoot a particular component or object, such as a SQL Server database or Windows process.
