# Management Pack Templates

As mentioned previously, Management Packs contain default monitoring for the application for which it is designed. Additionally, you can extend monitoring by using Management Pack templates. This provides the ability to create custom monitoring for an application and is particularly useful when a Management Pack does not exist for an application, such as application that has been developed in-house. Operations Manager includes the following Management Pack templates:

- **.NET Application Performance Monitoring Template:** Provides monitoring for Microsoft .NET Framework applications and services from both a client-side and server-side perspective.

- **OLE DB Data Source Template:** Provides monitoring for an OLE DB data source including the ability to test using T-SQL queries.

- **Process Monitoring Template:** Provides the ability to monitor the existence or non-existence of a running process.

- **TCP Port Template:** Provides the ability to monitor a given port such as a Telnet or a file transfer protocol (FTP) port.

- **UNIX or Linux Log File:** Provides the ability to monitor log files for existence of given strings.

- **UNIX or Linux Process:** Provides the ability to monitor the existence of a running process including the number of instances of that process.

- **Web Application Availability Monitoring Template:** Provides the ability to monitor the availability of a web application by specifying one or more URLs.

- **Web Application Transaction Monitoring Template:** Similar to the Web Application Availability Monitoring Template, this template also provides a web transaction recorder that you can use to capture multiple tests and the resulting URLs from each test.

- **Windows Service Template:** Provides the ability to monitor the availability of Windows services, including the ability to monitor all Windows services that are configured to start automatically.
