# Managing Update Drift

As Microsoft includes new features, functionality, and improvements with updates to the Azure Stack environment, it is important that you keep the Azure Stack infrastructure up-to-date. This ensures that your Azure Stack implementation includes all of the latest features. Additionally, keeping the Azure Stack environment up-to-date helps if you need to contact Microsoft with a support issue relating to Azure Stack because one of the first troubleshooting steps would most likely include updating to the latest version.

Update drift in Azure stack can occur if you do not apply updates when they are released by Microsoft in a timely fashion. This can be the case for a single region or in multiple regions, because the update process in Azure Stack is managed by region.

Microsoft monitors the installations of Azure Stack to ensure they are running the latest version. This is important because if you do not update your Azure Stack environment regularly, Microsoft can deem your installation as being non-compliant. If this happens, you must update your environment with the latest updates to bring it back into a complaint state.
