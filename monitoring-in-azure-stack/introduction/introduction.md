# Monitoring in Microsoft Azure Stack

As you have seen from previous modules, Microsoft Azure Stack includes a number of components that work together to provide the cloud services and resources you make available to users and customers. It is vitally important that each component is available and functioning optimally at all times. For this reason, you need to understand how Azure Stack monitors itself and how you can use Azure Stack to troubleshoot problems in the environment should they occur. Additionally, updating Azure Stack from both a security and functionality perspective is equally important. Microsoft releases regular updates for Azure Stack in a similar fashion to other Microsoft products. These updates provide additional features when they become available and can also include updates to the underlying infrastructure components to make Azure Stack more secure and reliable.

In this module, you will learn how Azure Stack is monitored and updated. You will also learn how to monitor guest workloads that users have provisioned by using Azure Stack. You will see how to troubleshoot the core components of Azure Stack. Finally, you will learn how the Azure Stack infrastructure is protected and how you also can protect user workloads.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the field replaceable unit concept in Azure Stack.

- Describe control plane monitoring in Azure Stack.

- Understand how updates are managed in Azure Stack.

- Monitor guest workloads in Azure Stack.

- Troubleshoot Azure Stack.

- Protect Azure Stack and user workloads.
