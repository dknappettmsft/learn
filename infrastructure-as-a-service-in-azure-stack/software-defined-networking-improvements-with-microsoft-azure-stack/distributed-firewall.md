# Distributed Firewall

The distributed firewall is a component of the Network Controller. It is responsible for applying traffic filters to subnets and virtual network adapters in a software-defined networking environment. In Azure Stack, the distributed firewall is surfaced through Network Security Groups (NSGs) for the tenants to control traffic within their networks. You can use a distributed firewall to prevent unwanted traffic from reaching a tenant workload and to ensure the workload remains unaware of the connection attempt. For example, you can use a distributed firewall to prevent unsolicited network traffic from outside of the tenantâ€™s virtual network from reaching an Active Directory domain controller.

The policies are distributed from the Network Controller to the Hyper-V hosts and the policies are applied at the virtual port-level within the Hyper-V virtual switch. The policy follows the virtual machine from host to host because the Hyper-V virtual switch is responsible for managing the traffic to the virtual machine.

Tenants define NSGs in Azure Stack. The following table shows an example of a NSG:

|Priority|Name|Source|Destination|Service|Action|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|200|SMB-In|10.10.0.0/16|192.168.1.0/24|Custom (TCP/445)|Allow|
|210|RDP-In|10.10.10.0/24|192.168.1.0/24|RDP (TCP/3389)|Allow|
|220|FTP-In|Any|192.168.1.0/24|FTP (TCP/21)|Deny|

The preceding example NSG would allow the following traffic:

- Server Message Block (SMB) (TCP port 445) traffic from any IP address that falls within the 10.10.0.0/16 subnet to a destination IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.

- RDP (TCP port 3389 by default) traffic from any IP address that falls within the 10.10.10.0/24 subnet to a destination IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.

This NSG would deny the following traffic:

- FTP (TCP port 21) traffic from any IP address to a destination IP address in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet

The preceding example NSG can be created by using an Azure Resource Manager template. The following snippet shows how to define the SMB-In rule:

```JSON
{
    "name": "SMB-In",
    "properties": {
        "protocol": "TCP",
        "sourcePortRange": "*",
        "destinationPortRange": "445",
        "sourceAddressPrefix": "10.10.0.0/16",
        "destinationAddressPrefix": "192.168.1.0/24",
        "access": "Allow",
        "priority": 250,
        "direction": "Inbound"
    }
}
```
